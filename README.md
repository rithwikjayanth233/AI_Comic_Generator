**Dream Tails: AI-Driven Comic Generation**

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the Dream Tails project, as well as innovative AI initiatives under the Mechanical and AI Lab at Carnegie Mellon University. 
These projects leverage cutting-edge machine learning techniques to transform textual descriptions into dynamic visual and audio media, fostering new ways to interact with digital content.


**Dream Tails**

Dream Tails focuses on generating animated visual narratives from structured text inputs. 
Using advanced diffusion models, this project aims to create consistent and sequential image outputs that maintain object and character consistency across frames.
This work supports a variety of applications, from educational tools to entertainment and beyond, pushing the boundaries of automated content creation.
